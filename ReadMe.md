The Job Analysis Project involves analyzing job data from a JSON file, implementing filtering and sorting functionality on a webpage to help users easily explore job listings. The project aims to build a comprehensive user interface that allows for interactive data exploration, including filtering by job attributes and sorting job listings. This will give you practical experience in working with JSON data, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.
